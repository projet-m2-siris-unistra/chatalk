# Protocols

The work is style in progress so some changes can be made, however the principle will hardly not change.

## Brainstorming and Conception

We need to set up protocols that will allow interactions between different entities.
There is three entities:

	* users,
	* the server,
	* and conversations (groups of users).

Conversations are considered as an entity because the message from a user is broadcast to a group of users. A conversation is much like a multicast group in a network.

### Message basic structure

- We thought of the easier way to analyse a message. To parse a message, we need to know its type.
	- It will give us two informations, the type of course but also the destination entity type.
	- As said before some message can only be send in a conversation (e.g. data : text, audio, video).
- Once, we know those two informations, we need to know precisely to which entity we have to send the message.
- So, we need an id (userId, conversationId or server : by default, 0). Then we will also need the sender id, e.g. to know which user sent the data.

So far, each message will have the following structure:

| 1      | 2                | 3          |
| ------ | ---------------- | -----------|
| *Type* | *Destination Id* | *Sender Id*|


### Message Exchange between client and server

In this section, we will describe different messages that will be needed for the proper functioning of the application.

#### Init messages

- From clients to the server:

	- SignIn : with the username and the password,
	- SignOut,
	- SignUp : with the username, password and the email adress.

- From the server to clients:

	- SignedIn,
	- SignedOut,
	- SignedUp : it can pass and the user will get his user_id, but it can also fail, the user has to retry then,
	- SendInfo : this message is send after a signedIn or a SignedUp message. It will contain other users informations as well as conversations informations.

#### Security Messages

The client has to send his SSH public key, while the server will send a common encrypted key for each conversation.
(c.f. securite section)

#### Conversation Management Messages

- A client can be add to a conversation by another user.
- If a user is writing a text content, a "UserIsWriting" message will be send to other members until the content is send by the user.
- The conversation name, picture and topic can be changed as well. 
	- Those messages will go through the server and be send to the users in the conversation.
	- The data will also be stored in the server database.
	- The server will maybe just have to check if the user has the right to do it.
- A new entity channel will be created for the user streams (audio,video).
	- The user will have to register to a channel and chose the desired content.
	- The server will broadcast the content to users in that given channel.

Messages Examples : 
```
Client -( Conversation Management) -> server
  add user
  UserIsWriting
  Change: - name
		  - picture
		  - topic
		  - pseudo in the conversation

Client -( Register )-> Server
  Sign to channel
  Sign to audio stream
  Sign to video stream
  Unsign from channel
  Unsign from audio stream
  Unsign from video stream

Server -( Conv. Management)-> Client
  ChangeDenied
  User Is Writing
  Someone Left
  Uptime
  Connexion Quality
  Someone changed:
	  - his name
	  - his picture
	  - the conversation name
  Someone Is Streaming
  Audio
  Video
```

#### Profile Management Messages

- Clients can manage their profile. Other options will be added if needed.

Messages Examples : 
```
Client -( Profile Management )-> Server
  Change avatar
  Change username
  Change password
Server -( Profile Management )-> Client
  Changed avatar
  Changed username
  Changed password
```

#### Data Messages

- The data from a user is broadcast to the conversation and stored in a database.
	- The content is encrypted with the conversation common key, so that the client can decrypt it.

Messages Examples : 
```
Client -( Data )-> Server
Server -( Data )-> Client
Server -( Data )-> Database
  Text
  Video
  Audio
  File
  â€¦ other
```

#### Request Messages

- Request messages are used by the server to check if the user is active or not.
- The user can request archives which will be send in the same message as the data one.
- In case, the user changes his IP address (e.g. activate the mobile data and turn off the wifi), he can update his IP address.
	- This means that the server will have to store multiple keys for the same user.
	- When the address is updated, the client send an info request.
	- The server will then send a "SendInfo" message (see Init messages).

Messages Examples : 
```
Client -( Request )-> Server
  Archives

Server -( Keep Alive )-> Client
Client -( Update )-> Server
  Update Current IP
Client -( Info Request ) -> Server
```

## Protobuf

To manage the protocols, we will use protobuf. It allows to get a parsed object instead of the raw data.

### Add a message

- To add a message, you will have to modify the *.proto* file in this directory.
- Those are the step to do it :
	- Create the message structure with `message MessageName {attributes}`.
		- MessageName become the type of the message.
	- Add fields that will be in the message, each field is add with this line : `type name = 1;`,
		- the type of the attribut (e.g. int, string, ...),
		- the name of the attribut,
		- the number of this field in the message.
	- Then add the message type, in the Client or the Server Message, inside the *oneof*.
		- You will just have to increment by one the highest number in the *oneof*.


### Examples

Here is an example:

- I want to add a conversation delete message, this will not be possible for our application. 
	- Indeed, a conversation is deleted only when all the members left it.
- I create the structure.

```
message ConvDelete {
	/* this field contain the conversation id, so no need to specify it again */
	int64 destination_id = 1;
	int64 sender_id = 2;
}
```

- Now, I add it to the client message : 
```
message MessageClient {
	oneof payload {
		[...]
		RequestInfo request_info = 13;
		ConvDelete conv_delete = 14;
		// add the structure and increment the last field number
		// oneof functioning is similar to union in c
	}
}
```
