## Visual identity

We decided to have a logo to represent our application.

![ChaTalK's logo](chatalk-square-512.png)

The logo is composed of a black sans-serif bold text on wich is written the name of our application in the following case `ChaTalK`.
Notice the upper `C`, `T` and `K`.

There are six mustaches representing the six members of the group for this project.

## Colors

The applications will propose, if we have time, two themes.

We will use a color, something turquoise, to highlight things like buttons.
This will be our primary color.

### Light theme (default)

This will be the default color set of our application.

It will use white and light grey variants for colors.

### Dark theme

Will be done only if we have time to do it.

It will use dark colors, mostly black and dark grey variants.

## Typography

The application aims to be user-friendly.
To offer a nice user experience, we decided to use a simple sans-serif font.

## Icons

We will use the icons provided by the Material Design here: https://material.io/resources/icons/.
