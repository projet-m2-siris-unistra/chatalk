# Blog

Created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

## Quick start

```sh
npm install # install all dependencies
npm run develop # watch for changes, ideal for developping
npm run format # format all code to be consistent
npm run build # generate a production-ready build
```

All blog posts are under `content/blog`.

To create a new post:

1. Create a new folder under `content/blog`
2. Create a new `index.md` file and put your content on it, you can copy one existing article to get started
3. You can put your images, etc. on the folder.

Here is a nice starter for your blog post:

```md
---
title: 'Title of my article'
date: '2019-10-20T20:00:00.000Z'
description: 'This is the content that will be displayed on the homepage.'
---

## Something

This is markdown content.
You can write content.

It supports all what you need, like this list:
- item1
- item2
- item3

## An other thing

You can insert images, links, ...
```

Please run `npm run format` before pushing your code!
